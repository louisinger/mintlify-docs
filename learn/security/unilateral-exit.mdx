Every VTXO includes a presigned Bitcoin transaction that lets you exit to the base layer without operator cooperation. This is Arkade's core security guarantee: **you can always get your Bitcoin back**.

## Why This Matters

| Scenario | What Happens | Your Action |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| Operator goes offline | Can't make new Arkade transactions | Broadcast exit tx |
| Operator refuses to cooperate | Can't do collaborative exit | Broadcast exit tx |
| Operator acts maliciously | Double-signing detected | Broadcast exit tx |
| You just want out | Any reason | Broadcast exit tx |

No matter what happens to the operator or the Arkade network, your presigned exit transaction is valid Bitcoin that miners will confirm.

## How Exit Works

VTXOs exist within a tree structure rooted in [batch outputs](/learn/pillars/batch-outputs). To exit, you broadcast a path of transactions from the batch output down to your VTXO.

<div style={{ display:"flex",justifyContent:"center" }}>
<img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/ark/exitpathlight.png"
  alt="Exit path"
  style={{ width:"100%",height:"auto" }}
/>

</div>

<div style={{ display:"flex",justifyContent:"center" }}>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block mx-auto"
  src="/images/ark/exitpathdark.png"
  alt="Exit path"
  style={{ width:"100%",height:"auto" }}
/>

</div>

**Example path:**

1. Batch Output → Virtual Tx A (unroll first level)
2. Virtual Tx A → Virtual Tx B (unroll second level)  
3. Virtual Tx B → Your UTXO (claim your Bitcoin)

Each step is a separate Bitcoin transaction that must be broadcast and confirmed.

## Exit Costs

The deeper your VTXO sits in the tree, the more transactions you need to broadcast:

| Tree Depth | Transactions Required | Est. Cost (at 10 sat/vB) |
|------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| 1 level | 1 tx | ~1,500 sats |
| 2 levels | 2 txs | ~3,000 sats |
| 3 levels | 3 txs | ~4,500 sats |
| 5 levels | 5 txs | ~7,500 sats |

<Warning>
Deep [transaction chains](/learn/pillars/arkade-tx#transaction-chains) increase exit costs. If you've chained many offchain transactions without settling, your exit path grows longer.
</Warning>

### When Exit Gets Expensive

- **High fee environment**: During Bitcoin fee spikes, exit costs multiply
- **Deep chains**: Many chained offchain transactions = many txs to broadcast
- **Small VTXOs**: Exit cost may exceed the VTXO value

This creates an economic incentive to [settle periodically](/learn/pillars/batch-swaps) rather than letting chains grow indefinitely.

## Initiating Exit

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
// Force exit - broadcasts presigned transactions
await wallet.redeem({ force: true })

// After CSV timelock expires, complete the exit
await wallet.redeem({ 
  complete: true, 
  address: 'bc1q...'  // Your Bitcoin address
})
```

```bash CLI
# Start unilateral exit
ark-cli redeem --force --password <pwd>

# After timelock, claim to Bitcoin address
ark-cli redeem --complete --address <destination> --password <pwd>
```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
The exit path includes a CSV (CheckSequenceVerify) timelock. You must wait for this delay before the final claim transaction is valid. This prevents double-spending between Arkade and Bitcoin.
</Info>

## Collaborative vs Unilateral Exit

| Exit Type | Speed | Cost | When to Use |
|-----------|-------|------|-------------|
| **Collaborative** | Instant | Lower (batched) | Normal operations, operator online |
| **Unilateral** | Hours (timelock) | Higher (multiple txs) | Emergency, operator unavailable |

Always try collaborative exit first. Unilateral exit is your backstop when collaboration isn't possible.

## What You Need to Exit

To execute a unilateral exit, your wallet must have:

1. **Presigned exit transactions** for your VTXOs
2. **Enough Bitcoin** for transaction fees (can be from the VTXO itself)
3. **Time** to wait for the CSV timelock

<Tip>
Your wallet stores presigned exit transactions automatically. As long as you have your wallet backup, you have everything needed to exit.
</Tip>

## Mass Exit Scenarios

If many users exit simultaneously (e.g., operator shutdown):

- Bitcoin fees may spike from increased demand
- Smaller VTXOs may become uneconomical to exit
- Users with larger balances can afford immediate exit
- Others may wait for fees to decrease

This is a known trade-off. The guarantee is that exit is always *possible*—but not always *cheap*.
