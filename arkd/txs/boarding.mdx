### What is Boarding?

**Boarding** enables users to bring external Bitcoin UTXOs into Arkade's execution environment and receive programmable Virtual Transaction Outputs (VTXOs) in return. This operation is coordinated between clients and Arkade through the [Intent System](/arkd/components/intent-system) and settles atomically within Arkade's [standard batch processing flow](/arkd/txs/onchain-settlement#client-workflow%3A-participating-in-a-batch-swap).

### Client API Overview

Clients interact with boarding functionality primarily through the [`ArkService`](/arkd/core-services/ark-service) gRPC interface. The service provides both gRPC and REST endpoints for all boarding operations.

### Getting Boarding Configuration

Clients first need to understand the boarding parameters by calling `GetInfo()` which returns [`GetInfoResponse`](https://github.com/arkade-os/arkd/blob/4cabf95f33b0196c47518425e92efc089636aa20/api-spec/protobuf/ark/v1/service.proto#L127-L142) server configuration parameters like network settings, amount limits, timeouts (e.g. expiry, exit delays), the operator’s signer key, and the current protocol version.

### Boarding Address Generation

Clients then generate a boarding address with two script paths:

- User \+ Server (collaborative)
- User \+ CSV (unilateral exit after timeout)

and send Bitcoin to said address.

### Intent Registration and Batch Processing Participation

After funding the boarding address, clients participate in the [standard batch processing flow](/arkd/txs/onchain-settlement#client-workflow%3A-participating-in-a-batch-swap):

1. **Registration**: Client registers an intent through `RegisterIntent()` with boarding inputs and a `BIP322` signature.
2. **Confirmation**: Client confirms participation via `ConfirmRegistration()`
3. **Tree Signing**: Client submits nonces and signatures for the Musig2 protocol
4. **Forfeit Transaction Submission**: Client submits signed [forfeit transactions](/learn/ark/batch-swaps#forfeit-transactions)
5. **Commitment Transaction Signing**: Client signs [commitment transaction](/learn/ark/tx-batching#commitment-transactions) for boarding inputs

The server validates boarding inputs during commitment transaction creation via [`validateBoardingInput`](https://github.com/arkade-os/arkd/blob/4cabf95f33b0196c47518425e92efc089636aa20/internal/core/application/service.go#L2211-L2284)

### Event Stream Monitoring

Clients can monitor the boarding progress through `GetEventStream()` , which returns [`GetEventStreamResponse`](https://github.com/arkade-os/arkd/blob/4cabf95f33b0196c47518425e92efc089636aa20/api-spec/protobuf/ark/v1/service.proto#L191-L202) and provides real-time updates about batch processing phases and transaction confirmations.


<Tip>From the client perspective, boarding is seamlessly integrated into the standard Arkade transaction flow. No special boarding APIs are needed; clients include their Bitcoin UTXOs as inputs in their intents and follow the existing batch processing protocol. The system handles boarding validation and processing transparently during the batch lifecycle.</Tip>
