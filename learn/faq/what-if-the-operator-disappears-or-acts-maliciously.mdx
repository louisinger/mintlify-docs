Arkade is designed with fail-safe exits and minimal trust assumptions.

If the [Operator goes offline](/learn/security/liveness#operator-liveness):
- Users can’t perform new transactions on Arkade
- Users can claim existing VTXOs as onchain funds using their presigned transactions

If the Operator misbehaves:
- Misconduct like double-signing attempts are cryptographically provable
- A [slashing mechanism](/learn/security/economic-security#slashing) enforces economic penalties
- Censorship-attempts of individual transactions are prevented via [E2E encryption](/learn/security/advanced-security#end-to-end-encryption) when those get sent to the Arkade Signer

While a unilateral exit path is always enforceable, [mass exits](/learn/security/risks-limitations#mass-exit-scenarios) may face high onchain transaction cost
