Arkade can [batch](/learn/pillars/batch-outputs) thousands of offchain operations into a single Bitcoin transaction output.

The settlement process is as follows:
1. Individual VTXOs get organized by the operator into a virtual transaction tree
2. The virtual transaction tree is anchored via a batch output in a commitment transaction to Bitcoin
3. An onchain confirmed commitment transaction gives all included VTXOs Bitcoin-level finality

Transaction batching dramatically reduces per-transaction costs while preserving individual control and Bitcoin security guarantees.
