Arkade has two liveness requirements: the operator must be online for transactions, and users must renew VTXOs before expiry.

## Operator Liveness

| Operator Status | What Works | What Doesn't |
|-----------------|------------|--------------|
| **Online** | Everything | — |
| **Offline** | Unilateral exits | New transactions, settlements |

When the operator goes offline:

- ✅ Your funds are safe (presigned exit transactions still valid)
- ✅ You can exit to Bitcoin anytime
- ❌ Can't send new Arkade payments
- ❌ Can't participate in batch swaps
- ❌ Can't renew expiring VTXOs

The operator has strong economic incentives to maintain uptime—they earn fees only while online.

## User Liveness (VTXO Expiry)

VTXOs expire. Before expiry, you must renew by participating in a [batch swap](/learn/pillars/batch-swaps).

| Status | Unilateral Exit? | Can Spend Offchain? |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Active VTXO** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Expired VTXO** | ❌ No | ❌ No (recoverable only) |

### What Happens If You Miss Expiry

1. Operator sweeps the expired batch output
2. You receive an [Arkade Note](/arkd/components/ark-notes) for your claim
3. You can recover funds in a future batch swap
4. You temporarily lose unilateral exit rights

<Warning>
Expiry is real. If you hold VTXOs and go offline for extended periods without delegation, you risk losing unilateral exit capability.
</Warning>

### How to Stay Safe

**Option 1: Active Management**

```typescript
// Check for expiring VTXOs
const vtxos = await wallet.getVtxos()
const expiringSoon = vtxos.filter(v => {
  const expiresIn = v.expiresAt - Date.now()
  return expiresIn < 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 // 7 days
})

if (expiringSoon.length > 0) {
  await wallet.settle() // Renew via batch swap
}
```

**Option 2: Delegation**

Appoint a third party to renew VTXOs on your behalf. They can only renew to addresses you specify—no custody risk.

**Option 3: Service Workers (Web)**

For web wallets, use a [service worker](/wallets/v0.3/service-worker) to handle renewal in the background.

## Practical Recommendations

| Use Case | Recommended Approach |
|----------|---------------------|
| Active daily user | Manual renewal when prompted |
| Weekly user | Set calendar reminder or use delegation |
| Long-term holder | Use delegation or settle to Bitcoin |
| Web wallet | Implement service worker |
| Mobile wallet | Silent push notifications for renewal |

## Expiry Timing

Batch expiry periods are set by the operator. Typical values:

| Network | Typical Expiry |
|---------|---------------|
| Mainnet | 2-4 weeks |
| Testnet | 1 week |
| Regtest | Hours (for testing) |

Check your operator's configuration:

```typescript
const info = await wallet.getInfo()
console.log('Expiry period:', info.vtxoExpiryBlocks, 'blocks')
```
