Settlement is the critical process that moves Virtual UTXOs (VTXOs) from a pre-confirmed state to their final confirmed state on the Bitcoin blockchain. 

In Arkade, VTXOs can exist in two primary states: 
- **pending** (pre-confirmed) 
- **settled** (batched on-chain)

When a VTXO is first created through an off-chain transaction, it exists in the pending state where it can be used for further off-chain activity but carries trust assumptions about the Operator. 

Through the settlement process, these pending VTXOs are included in a Commitment Transaction and anchored to the Bitcoin blockchain, providing them with full settlement guarantees and unilateral exit rights.

```typescript
// Get all VTXOs and check their status
const vtxos = await wallet.getVtxos()
const pendingVtxos = vtxos.filter(vtxo => vtxo.status === 'pending')
const settledVtxos = vtxos.filter(vtxo => vtxo.status === 'settled')

console.log('Pending VTXOs:', pendingVtxos.length)
console.log('Settled VTXOs:', settledVtxos.length)
```

For more detailed information about the batch swap process that underlies settlement, see the [Ark Batch Swaps documentation](https://docs.arklabs.xyz/ark/deep-dive/batch-swaps).
