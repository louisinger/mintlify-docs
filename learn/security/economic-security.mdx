Arkade's security relies on both cryptographic guarantees and economic incentives. Operators are financially motivated to behave honestly.

## Fee Structure

Operators earn from two fee types:

| Fee Type | When Charged | Who Pays |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| **Execution fee** | Each offchain transaction | Sender |
| **Settlement fee** | Batch swap to Bitcoin | Shared by batch participants |

### Execution Fees

Small fees (fractions of a satoshi) on each Arkade transaction. These add up with volume.

```
100,000 transactions/day × 0.5 sat/tx = 50,000 sats/day
```

### Settlement Fees

Charged when users anchor VTXOs to Bitcoin via batch swaps. The onchain transaction cost is shared across all participants.

```
1 batch = 1 Bitcoin transaction
100 users in batch = 100-way fee split
```

## Incentive Alignment

The fee model creates natural incentives:

| Operator Behavior | Economic Effect |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Stay online | Earn execution fees |
| Process quickly | Users prefer fast operators |
| Batch efficiently | Lower per-user costs = more users |
| Don't censor | Censored users go elsewhere |
| Be honest | Misbehavior triggers slashing |

**Revenue requires reliability.** An offline or misbehaving operator earns nothing.

## Slashing Mechanism

Operators can stake Bitcoin collateral that gets destroyed if they misbehave.

### How It Works

```
Operator stakes collateral
        ↓
Collateral locked to Signer public key
        ↓
If double-signing detected:
  - User presents proof to TEE
  - TEE signs burn transaction
  - Collateral destroyed
```

### Economic Rationality

For an attack to be rational:

```
Attack profit > Collateral value
```

If the operator stakes 1 BTC and could only gain 0.1 BTC from fraud, attacking is irrational.

### Slashing Triggers

| Trigger | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| Double-signing | Two valid signatures for conflicting transactions |
| Protocol violation | TEE attestation shows unauthorized code |

<Info>
Slashing is a last resort. The primary deterrent is reputation—operators who misbehave lose all their users permanently.

## Competitive Pressure

Arkade supports multiple operators. Users can choose based on:

| Factor | User Preference |
|--------|-----------------|
| Fees | Lower is better |
| Uptime | Higher is better |
| Reputation | Established operators preferred |
| Collateral | More stake = more trust |
| Settlement frequency | More batches = faster finality |

Competition prevents any single operator from exploiting users.

## Operator Economics

A sustainable operator needs:

| Revenue | Cost |
|---------|------|
| Execution fees | Server infrastructure |
| Settlement fees | Liquidity capital |
| | VTXO tree funding |
| | Collateral stake |

Operators must provide significant upfront capital to fund VTXO trees, creating economic skin in the game beyond just collateral.

## User Perspective

You benefit from economic security without thinking about it:

- **Low fees** — operators compete for your business
- **Reliable service** — downtime costs operators money
- **Honest execution** — fraud triggers slashing
- **Fast settlement** — efficiency benefits everyone
