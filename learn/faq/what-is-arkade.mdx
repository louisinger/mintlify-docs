Arkade is a programmable execution layer for Bitcoin.

It enables a multitude of fast, self-custodial financial applications on Bitcoin, including [Lightning payments](/contracts/lightning-swaps), [synthetic assets](/experimental/synthetic-assets), or even [prediction markets](/experimental/prediction-market), without requiring consensus changes to the Bitcoin protocol.

With Arkade, you can:
- Access lending protocols without giving up custody of your Bitcoin
- Trade on decentralized exchanges without custodial intermediaries
- Build smart wallets with embedded logic and recovery mechanisms
- Deploy programmable payments and contracts

Operations execute offchain for speed, with users choosing when to anchor to Bitcoin for full security.
