## 🧩 Arkade Roles

Arkade defines two main roles: **Users** and **Operators**.

Users hold and transact Virtual UTXOs (VTXOs). They initiate Ark transactions and can exit to Bitcoin unilaterally at
any time.

The Operator coordinates execution and settlement. The role is modular. It can be run by one entity or split across
independent actors. The Operator consists of:

- **Ark Signer**: verifies and signs Ark transactions
- **Ark Batcher**: collects intents and builds transaction batches
- **Liquidity Providers**: fund batch commitments with Bitcoin

This separation of concerns gives Arkade a modular trust surface. Operators can be unbundled.

## 📦 Virtual Mempool

The Virtual Mempool processes Ark transactions. These are Bitcoin-like spends of VTXOs, composed offchain, and executed
in parallel.

VTXOs follow Bitcoin’s stateless model. Every transaction is local and deterministic. There is no shared state.
Transactions form a DAG, not a blockchain.

## 🔐 Ark Signer

Arkade enforces execution integrity not through staking, committees, or onchain slashing contracts, but by binding a
single-purpose signer to a deterministic program running inside sealed hardware.

The Ark Signer operates within a **Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)**. This enclave runs only one specific, attested
binary, which any user can verify. The binary generates a private key internally and exposes only the public key. All
VTXOs in the system require this key to co-sign.

To establish accountability, the Ark Operator locks Bitcoin to an onchain address spendable only by this signer key. These UTXOs
are visible on the Bitcoin blockchain. No complex "bonding" contract governs them. Instead, security flows from the predictability of the
signer’s behavior: it will not actively collude with previous owner to double-spend a VTXO. 

If a violation does occur, the user does not appeal to a protocol or validator set. Instead:

1. The user detects a double-sign and constructs the proof.
2. The user builds an unsigned **burn transaction**, sweeping the signer’s bonded UTXOs to an unspendable address.
3. The user sends both the proof and transaction to the Ark Signer via end-to-end encrypted messaging.
4. The signer verifies the proof and, by its own logic, signs the burn. The bond is destroyed onchain.

The signer cannot refuse this action. It cannot be patched or reconfigured without the entire world noticing and trigger a mass unilateral exit and loss of reputation as reliable Ark operator. 
Double-spending can only occur through intentional data corruption or operator-induced resets. 


## 🧃 Coordination Layer

The Coordination Layer links user intents (chain of VTXOs in a pre-confirmed state) with onchain funding and ordering logic.

The **Ark Batcher** collects user intents and constructs batches. It follows deterministic rules and may run in its own
TEE. The output is a virtual transaction tree passed to the Ark Signer for execution.

**Liquidity Providers** fund batch outputs. They post capital to Bitcoin in return for fee yield. Each provider cosigns
the batch expiry path. A pre-signed sweep transaction allows withdrawal if a round fails.

Coordination is modular. Anyone can operate a batcher or provide liquidity.

---

## 🧱 Bitcoin Settlement Layer

The Settlement Layer anchors Arkade batches on Bitcoin.

Each batch produces a single UTXO. It encapsulates many VTXOs in one output. Settlement happens only when needed. Users
choose when to exit. Each VTXO includes a presigned onchain path.

This guarantees safety. If the Ark Signer disappears or misbehaves, the user can still reclaim funds without permission.

Finality is inherited from Bitcoin. Once settled, VTXOs cannot be reversed or re-signed. Preconfirmed state becomes
immutable.

Arkade transforms Bitcoin’s primitive transaction model into a verifiable, modular execution layer. Trust is minimal.
Security is enforced with TEEs and cryptographic accountability. Execution is fast. Exit is deterministic. Consensus is
unchanged.
