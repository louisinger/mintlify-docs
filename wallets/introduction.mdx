Arkade wallets are simple to integrate and use. Arkade integrates directly without external daemons by design. Developers can interact with the protocol using standard Bitcoin-compatible infrastructure and purpose-built native SDKs in various languages.

Whether you're building for your own custody or shipping self-custodial wallets for your users, the SDK is flexible by design. If you want to go deeper, the lower-level APIs give you everything you need to build custom integrations from scratch.



## TypeScript SDK

In the following developer guides, we'll primarily use JavaScript/TypeScript for examples, but the concepts apply to all SDKs.

<Accordion title="Supported Platforms" icon="laptop-code" defaultOpen={true}>
  Our TypeScript SDK supports multiple platforms:

  - **Browser** - For web applications
  - **React Native** - For mobile applications
  - **Node.js** - For server-side applications
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Key Features" icon="star">
  - **Self-custody** - You control your keys, always
  - **Instant Payments** - No waiting for confirmations with off-chain transactions
  - **Low Fees** - Significantly reduced transaction costs
  - **Simple API** - Intuitive methods that abstract away complexity
  - **Bitcoin-compatible** - Works with standard Bitcoin infrastructure
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Getting Support" icon="headset">
  If you need help with the SDK or have feature requests:
  
  - Join the [Arkade Telegram community](https://t.me/arkade_os)
  - Open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/arkade-os/ts-sdk/issues)
  - Learn more about [Arkade architecture](/learn/architecture)
  
  This is just the beginning. If there's something you wish the SDK did — tell us. We're listening.
</Accordion>


### Reference Wallet Implementation

Arkade provides a reference wallet implementation that demonstrates best practices and serves as a practical example for developers:

- **Arkade Wallet** - [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/arkade-os/wallet)

The reference wallet showcases how to implement key features such as:

- Creating and managing self-custodial wallets
- Sending Bitcoin transactions in Arkade
- Balance and Payment detection
- Transaction history
- Service worker for background processing

Exploring this implementation can help you understand how to effectively integrate Arkade into your own applications.

### Other Languages

Arkade also provides libraries for other programming languages:

- **Rust** - [Arkade Rust Crates](https://github.com/arkade-os/rust-sdk)
- **Go** - [Arkade Go Package](https://github.com/arkade-os/go-sdk)

Refer to the respective README files for detailed usage instructions.
