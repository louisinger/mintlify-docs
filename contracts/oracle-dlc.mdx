Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs) allow conditional payouts based on external data, provided by trusted oracles. Arkade aims to simplify DLC creation and management while retaining strong privacy and security guarantees.

## Coming Soon

Future documentation will include:

- Setting up oracle connections
- Crafting DLC payout structures
- Settlement and arbitration workflows
- Real-world examples (prediction markets, hedging contracts)
