## Prerequisites

<Tip>
  Ensure you have the following installed before getting started:

  - Node.js (v22 or higher)
</Tip>

## Installation

```bash
npm install @arkade-os/sdk
```

## Arkade Operator Instances

To test your integration against a live environment, you can connect to the following live Arkade Operator instances: 

| **Network** | **URL**                                                           | **Status**    |
| :---------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------ |
| Mutinynet   | [<u>https://mutinynet.arkade.sh</u>](https://mutinynet.arkade.sh) | ✅ Active      |
| Signet      | [<u>https://signet.arkade.sh</u>](https://signet.arkade.sh)       | ✅ Active      |


## Basic Setup

<Note>
  When creating a wallet, you can use an existing private key or generate a new one. For production applications, always use a secure key management solution rather than hardcoded keys.
</Note>

```typescript
import { SingleKey, Wallet } from '@arkade-os/sdk'

// use your private key in hex format  
const identity = SingleKey.fromHex('secret')

// create a wallet instance
const wallet = await Wallet.create({
  identity,
  arkServerUrl: 'https://mutinynet.arkade.sh',
})

// You can receive bitcoin offchain instantly! No inbound liquidity!
const address = await wallet.getAddress()
console.log('Ark Address:', address)
```

## Local Arkade Operator

If you want to run Arkade locally for testing, you can start a Nigiri environment with Arkade support enabled:

```bash
nigiri start --ark 
```

Once running, Nigiri will spin up a local Bitcoin regtest network with an Arkade Operator instance. You can connect your SDK to it using the following URL:

| **Network** | **URL**                                                           | **Status**    |
| :---------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------ |
| Regtest     | [<u>http://localhost:7070</u>](http://localhost:7070)             | Self-deployed |

This lets you test wallet creation, offchain payments, and unilateral exits without touching public test networks.
