The Arkade Operator coordinates offchain activity through a modular architecture comprising several functions: transaction aggregation and validation, onchain batch creation and liquidity provisioning.

The Operator:
- Coordinates transactions in the Virtual Mempool
- Issues preconfirmations for instant execution
- Posts settlement batches to Bitcoin via [commitment transactions](/learn/pillars/batch-outputs#commitment-transactions)
- Cannot control user funds — every VTXO includes presigned Bitcoin exit paths

For added security, critical roles like the Arkade Signer are separated from the operator and run independently within a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), providing verifiable proof of correct behavior and preventing even the operator from accessing signing keys.
