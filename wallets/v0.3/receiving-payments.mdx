## Overview

Receiving payments with Arkade is designed for instant, low-fee Bitcoin transfers. Your Arkade wallet generates an offchain address that allows anyone to send you Bitcoin instantly within the Arkade network, or through Lightning Network swaps.

## Getting Your Arkade Address

To receive payments, generate your offchain Arkade address:

```typescript
const offchainAddress = await wallet.getAddress()

// The offchain Arkade address for instant payments
console.log('Ark Address:', offchainAddress)
```

<Tip>This is your primary receiving address for everyday payments. Share this address to receive instant, near-zero fee Bitcoin payments from other Arkade wallets.</Tip>

## Arkade Addresses

Arkade addresses start with `ark1` on Bitcoin mainnet or `tark1` on testnet and regtest.

## Receiving from Lightning Network

Your Arkade wallet can receive payments from the Lightning Network through submarine swaps. This allows Lightning users to pay you instantly, with the funds settling into your Arkade wallet as VTXOs.

## Monitoring for Incoming Payments

To detect when payments are received, you can use `wallet.notifyIncomingFunds()` for incoming VTXOs in real-time.

```typescript
// Example function to process incoming funds
async function processIncomingFunds(notification: IncomingFunds) {
  // Update your application state
  switch (notification.type) {
    case 'vtxo':
      for (const vtxo of notification.vtxos) {
        console.log(`Received payment of ${vtxo.amount} sats`);

        // You might want to store the VTXO in your database
        await storeVtxoInDatabase(vtxo);

        // Notify the user
        showNotification(`Received ${vtxo.amount} sats!`);

        // Update the UI
        await refreshBalanceDisplay();
      }
      break;
    case 'utxo':
      // UTXOs received on boarding addresses (see Ramps documentation)
      for (const utxo of notification.utxos) {
        await storeBoardingUtxoInDatabase(utxo)
        showNotification(`Received ${utxo.amount} sats on boarding address!`);
        await refreshBalanceDisplay();
      }
      break;
  }
}

// Start the subscription
const stop = wallet.notifyIncomingFunds(processIncomingFunds)

// Stop the subscription when needed
stop()
```

<Note>
  The `utxo` notification type is only relevant when using [boarding addresses](/wallets/v0.3/ramps#boarding) to onboard Bitcoin into Arkade. For everyday receiving, you'll primarily work with `vtxo` notifications.

### Best Practices

<Accordion title="Error Handling" icon="shield-check">
  Always implement proper error handling for your subscription to ensure your application remains stable even if there are network issues.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Reconnection Logic" icon="repeat">
  Consider implementing reconnection logic if the subscription is interrupted due to network issues.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Deduplication" icon="filter">
  Implement deduplication logic to ensure you don't process the same payment multiple times, especially if your application restarts.
</Accordion>
