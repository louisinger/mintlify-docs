1.  **Boarding & Creation**: VTXOs are created when users deposit into Arkade or when an existing VTXO is spent, creating new output VTXOs.
2.  **Spending**: VTXOs can be spent by creating Arkade Transactions that consume them as inputs and create new VTXOs as outputs. This process mirrors Bitcoin's UTXO model, but is executed instantly.
3.  **Preconfirmed State**: In this state, the VTXO has been validated and cosigned by the Arkade Signer but has not yet been settled onchain. It can be spent immediately within the Virtual Mempool.  
4.  **Bitcoin Finality**: To inherit Bitcoin’s full security guarantees, a VTXO obtains finality when included in a batch output within a commitment transaction anchored to the Bitcoin blockchain.
6.  **Exit**: VTXOs can be turned into onchain UTXOs either collaboratively with the operator or unilaterally through the presigned exit path.

  **VTXO Security Considerations**

- Expiry Risk: Users lose unilateral control of their VTXO(s) after expiry, but can reclaim those by showing an ownership proof of expired funds.
- VTXO States: Preconfirmed VTXOs require honest operator behavior. Batch Swapping preconfirmed VTXOs gives them Bitcoin Finality.
- Dust Outputs: VTXOs below Bitcoin's dust limit are represented via an OP_RETURN + pubkey), making them unspendable via unilateral exit but still valid for offchain usage. 
- Deep transaction chains: VTXOs part of a deep Arkade transaction chain makes unilateral exit more expensive as all respective branch transactions would need to be broadcast.
