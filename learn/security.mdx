## **Bitcoin-Native Security**

Arkade enables programmable Bitcoin applications by **separating execution from settlement and custody**. 

This architectural separation creates unique trust boundaries: **execution** happens instantly offchain through operator coordination, while **settlement and custody** remain under user control and enforceable onchain.

Using a presigned transaction architecture, Arkade coordinates fast, programmable execution offchain while settlement and custody remain anchored to Bitcoin's security model. Every Arkade transaction is fundamentally a Bitcoin transaction with direct spending paths enforcing unilateral exit capability. 

Instant transaction execution happens through a preconfirmation mechanism. User transactions are co-signed by the Arkade Signer in the **Virtual Mempool**, forming chains of transaction logic. This mechanism requires users to rely on operator incentives during preconfirmed execution.

Users maintain control over their funds and choose when to transition from a preconfirmed state to Bitcoin finality through batch settlements. This model enables instant programmable flows when speed is prioritized, with the option to inherit full Bitcoin security guarantees when needed.

**Architecture Note**: Unlike bridge-based systems that create wrapped Bitcoin requiring trust in external validators, Arkade's presigned transaction model means every Virtual Transaction Output (VTXO) is backed by a valid Bitcoin transaction. Users hold the cryptographic keys to exit unilaterally at any time, transforming offchain execution from a custody model into a coordination model.

## Unilateral Exit

Every VTXO includes a presigned transaction path that enables its owner to exit to Bitcoin independently. When a VTXO is created, it comes with a valid set of Bitcoin transactions that can be broadcast at any time without requiring signatures or cooperation from operators or other users.

### Exit Requirements

Arkade's architecture organizes VTXOs in a virtual tree structure rooted into Batch Outputs. Each Batch Output branches into multiple virtual transactions, which can further branch into additional virtual transactions, creating a tree-like structure of spending relationships. Individual VTXOs exist as leaves or intermediate nodes within this virtual tree.

To enforce a unilateral exit claim onchain, users must publish a complete transaction path from the relevant Batch Output down to their specific VTXO. This requires broadcasting multiple sequential Bitcoin transactions that "unroll" the virtual tree structure, with each transaction in the chain consuming outputs from the previous transaction until the user's VTXO is finally claimed.

**Example Exit Path:**

1. Batch Output → Virtual Transaction A (first level)  
2. Virtual Transaction A → Virtual Transaction B (second level)  
3. Virtual Transaction B → User's VTXO (final claim)

Each transaction in this chain must be individually broadcast and confirmed on Bitcoin, with users paying standard Bitcoin network fees for each transaction.

### Exit Costs

**Base Costs:** Every unilateral exit incurs Bitcoin network fees for each required transaction in the path. A VTXO requiring a 3-transaction exit path costs 3x the base Bitcoin transaction fee, regardless of the VTXO's value.

**Chain Length Impact:** As users engage in more offchain activity, their VTXOs move deeper into the virtual tree structure, creating longer exit paths. Extended offchain transaction chains compound exit costs:

* Direct child of Batch Output: 1 Bitcoin transaction required  
* Second-level VTXO: 2 Bitcoin transactions required  
* Third-level VTXO: 3 Bitcoin transactions required  
* And so on...

**F**or smaller VTXO values, exit costs can become prohibitive. With high Bitcoin fees, the cumulative cost of publishing multiple transactions may exceed the VTXO's balance, effectively stranding smaller holdings until either Bitcoin fees decrease or the VTXO value is enough to cover the expense.

This cost structure creates natural economic incentives for users to periodically refresh their VTXOs through batch settlement rather than allowing exit paths to grow indefinitely. Users must balance the convenience of extended offchain activity against the related cost of maintaining unilateral exit optionality.

## **Transaction Finality**

Arkade enables users to seamlessly shift between preconfirmation and Bitcoin finality Ebased on their security and performance requirements.

### **Preconfirmation**

Funds in the Virtual Mempool operate under the preconfirmation trust model. All Virtual Transaction Outputs (VTXOs) are cosigned by the Arkade Signer, enabling instant transaction execution and rich programmable flows.

This model requires users to trust the Arkade Signer won't double-sign conflicting transactions. Any misbehavior can be cryptographically proven, while economic incentives and deterministic execution ensure reliable operation.

### Bitcoin Finality

Finality is achieved when users swap their preconfirmed VTXOs into a new Batch Output confirmed on Bitcoin. 

Users can balance security needs against convenience by choosing when to settle. 

Settled VTXOs, while structurally identical to preconfirmed ones, are solely traceable back to Batch Output transactions, ensuring full Bitcoin-level immutability and censorship resistance. 

## Liveness

Arkade's operational model involves two critical liveness requirements: operator availability and user activity management.

###Operator Liveness

Arkade uses a server-client architecture where operator downtime disrupts functionality. When the operator goes offline, users cannot initiate new transactions until the operator returns, but existing funds remain completely safe through presigned exit transactions. Users retain the ability to exit unilaterally at any time, regardless of operator status. The duration of any downtime depends entirely on the operator's infrastructure resilience and recovery capabilities.

### User Liveness (VTXO Expiry)

VTXOs have built-in expiry mechanisms that require periodic user attention. As VTXOs age in the virtual mempool, users must periodically swap them through batch settlement to avoid expiry. 

Expired VTXOs are swept by the Arkade Operator. While users may recover their funds, they lose the ability to unilaterally enforce ownership claims onchain. This creates natural incentives for users to remain active and settle their pre-confirmed VTXOs appropriately.

### Modular Architecture

Arkade's infrastructure is designed with a modular architecture that can be distributed and scaled independently. Core operator functions include validation and transaction cosigning, batch creation, liquidity provisioning, and overall system coordination with user interfaces.

This modular approach creates opportunities to scale Arkade horizontally and build redundancy options. Different functions can be replicated across multiple infrastructure providers, geographic regions, or even operated by different entities, reducing single points of failure and improving system resilience.

## Advanced Security Mechanisms

Rather than asking users to simply trust operators, Arkade implements technical safeguards that transform "trust the operator" into "verify the operator." These mechanisms ensure that misbehavior is cryptographically detectable, honest execution is verifiable, economic incentives are aligned, and communication remains uncensorable.

### Verifiable Execution

To minimize trust risks in the preconfirmation state, Arkade isolates the Arkade Signer within Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). TEEs create isolated hardware environments that can attest to the software they're running and can provide robust guarantees against external tampering. 

The Arkade Signer operates within this isolated TEE environment to independently manage the cryptographic keys used for signing transactions. This isolation makes key exfiltration or tampering practically infeasible, with the signing key generated and securely maintained internally, inaccessible even to the Arkade Operator. Signing responsibilities remain strictly segregated from broader operational tasks.

The system also plans to integrate remote, verifiable attestation based on open-source software and reproducible builds. These attestations serve as cryptographic verification that the Ark Signer is running the expected code.

### End-to-End Encryption

Arkade is designed to support end-to-end encryption (E2EE) between users and the Arkade Signer, preserving confidentiality and protecting against censorship attempts by the operator. 

The E2EE protocol safeguards signature requests and other messages from interception or manipulation, rendering the Arkade Operator incapable of snooping on or censoring specific transactions. Even when the operator serves as the message routing infrastructure, they cannot:

* See what specific transactions are being processed  
* Block individual transactions based on their content  
* Analyze user behavior patterns for surveillance purposes

## Economic Security

### Collateral Burn Mechanism

Arkade Operators can stake Bitcoin collateral onchain, locked to the Arkade Signer's public key, creating economic deterrence against misbehavior. If the Signer double-signs conflicting transactions, users can present proof to the TEE along with an unsigned burn transaction, which the verified TEE software will automatically sign to destroy the collateral.

Since TEEs cannot reliably maintain global state, malicious operators might attempt to induce double-signing by feeding incorrect data to the TEE or performing restart cycles. However, such protocol violations produce cryptographic evidence that triggers the collateral burn mechanism. The system ensures that potential attack benefits must outweigh the locked collateral value, making attacks economically irrational for operators.

### Fee Incentives

Arkade operators earn revenue through a dual fee structure that aligns their incentives with reliable execution. 

Execution fees are collected for offchain transactions in the Virtual Mempool, while settlement fees are earned when transactions are batched to Bitcoin. 

Since settlement fees are shared across many users in each batch, operators are incentivized to aggregate transactions efficiently and maintain high throughput.

This fee model creates positive economic incentives for operators to remain online, process transactions promptly, and avoid censorship that would drive users to competing operators. The recurring revenue from fees provides sustainable economic motivation for honest behavior. Operators who provide reliable service and efficient batching earn higher transaction volumes and associated fees.

## **Risks & Limitations**

### Mass Exit Scenarios

Mass exit events occur when large numbers of users simultaneously attempt to exit the system, typically triggered by operator infrastructure failures, concerns about operator behavior, regulatory interventions, or system vulnerabilities. When the Arkade Operator goes offline, users lose the ability to initiate new transactions but retain full control over existing VTXOs through presigned unilateral exit paths.

The critical challenge emerges when high demand for exits coincides with elevated Bitcoin network fees. Exit costs can become prohibitively expensive, particularly for smaller VTXO values where fees may exceed the balance itself. Users with larger holdings can afford immediate exit, while smaller holders must weigh immediate exit costs against waiting for lower Bitcoin fees. The length of VTXO transaction chains directly affects exit costs, as longer chains require more complex Bitcoin transactions to unroll.

Operators face strong incentives to restore service quickly due to lost fee revenue, while the modular architecture may enable rapid migration to alternative infrastructure. Ongoing research and protocol optimization aim to enhance user coordination capabilities and minimize the economic impact of mass exit events.

### Arkade Signer Compromise

Compromise of the Arkade Signer occurs when cryptographic keys are breached, potentially through software vulnerabilities, infrastructure attacks, or other security failures. TEEs provide additional hardware protection, but compromise remains possible through various means. 

In this scenario, a malicious actor could use the Signer keys to unroll certain chains of transactions and sign conflicting ownership claims.

Detection occurs through remote attestation failures and cryptographic evidence of conflicting signatures. The Arkade Operator is expected to halt the system immediately, preventing potential abuse. Users should cease creating new VTXOs and prepare for emergency exits if holding potentially affected VTXOs.

TEE compromise represents a critical failure mode where the hardware isolation protecting Arkade Signer keys is breached through vulnerabilities in TEE hardware, side-channel attacks, or software stack compromise. Unlike operator downtime which affects availability, TEE compromise enables double-signing attacks where the same VTXO could be validly assigned to multiple users, creating irreconcilable ownership disputes.

Detection occurs through remote attestation failures and cryptographic evidence of conflicting signatures. When compromise is detected, new signature operations halt immediately while the collateral burn mechanism activates automatically upon cryptographic proof of double-signing. Users should cease creating new VTXOs and prepare for emergency exits if holding potentially affected VTXOs.
