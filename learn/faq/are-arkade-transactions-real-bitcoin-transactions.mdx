Yes - and no.

Every [Arkade transaction](/learn/pillars/arkade-tx):
- Is structured like a Bitcoin transaction (inputs, outputs, scripts)
- Produces valid presigned Bitcoin exit paths
- Can be anchored to Bitcoin via batch outputs

Arkade transactions are executed instantly offchain with preconfirmations, then batch settled onchain whenever convenient for the user. Arkade keeps this tradeoff explicit: users and applications control when to finalize to Bitcoin and reclaim full security guarantees.
