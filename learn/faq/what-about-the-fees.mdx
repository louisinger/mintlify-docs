Arkade uses a batched fee model optimized for cost efficiency.

Two fee types:
- Execution fees covering offchain transactions in the Virtual Mempool
- Settlement fees for anchoring onto Bitcoin (shared across all users)

Benefits:
- Thousands of transactions batched into a single Bitcoin output
- Onchain fees split across all batch participants
- Priority settlement available for faster confirmation

Fee alignment:
- Operators earn from both fee types
- Incentivizes efficient execution and fair settlement
- All fees paid in Bitcoin
