Arkade enables Bitcoin applications that were previously impossible without bridges, wrapped tokens, or custodial services. Here's what developers are building.

## Payments

### Instant Wallet-to-Wallet

Send Bitcoin instantly between Arkade wallets with near-zero fees. No block confirmations, no channel management.

```typescript
await wallet.sendBitcoin({
  address: 'ark1q...',
  amount: 50000
})
```

**Why Arkade:** Sub-second settlement, fees under 1 sat, works on any device.

### Lightning Interoperability

Accept Lightning payments that settle as Arkade VTXOs. Pay Lightning invoices from your Arkade balance.

```typescript
// Receive from Lightning
const invoice = await boltz.createInvoice(10000)
// ... Lightning sender pays invoice
await boltz.claimSwap(invoice.id)
```

**Why Arkade:** Bridge Lightning's reach with Arkade's simplicity. No channel liquidity management.

## Smart Wallets

### Spending Limits

Enforce daily or per-transaction limits without custodial infrastructure.

```
// Arkade Script (experimental)
fn spend(tx, limit: u64) {
  require(tx.output_sum() <= limit)
}
```

**Why Arkade:** Programmable controls run offchain but remain enforceable onchain.

### Social Recovery

Allow trusted contacts to help recover funds if you lose access, without giving them custody.

**Why Arkade:** Recovery paths are encoded in VTXOs. No centralized recovery service needed.

### Multi-Party Approval

Require multiple signatures for high-value transactions while keeping everyday spending simple.

**Why Arkade:** Flexible signing policies per VTXO. Different rules for different amounts.

---

## Trading & Exchange

### Non-Custodial Exchange

Users trade directly from their wallets. The exchange never takes custody.

**Why Arkade:** Atomic swaps happen in the virtual mempool. Settlement is instant.

### Orderbook Matching

Match buy and sell orders offchain, settle atomically when trades execute.

**Why Arkade:** Parallel execution means no bottlenecks. Thousands of trades per second.

## Lending & Credit

### Bitcoin-Collateralized Loans

Borrow against Bitcoin without surrendering custody. Collateral stays in a VTXO you control.

**Why Arkade:** Loan terms encoded in VTXO scripts. Liquidation is trustless and automatic.

### Yield on Bitcoin

Lend Bitcoin to earn yield. Repayment terms are enforced by the protocol.

**Why Arkade:** No rehypothecation risk. Borrowers can't misuse collateral.

---

## Autonomous Agents

### AI Payment Rails

Let AI agents send and receive Bitcoin programmatically for API calls, compute resources, or services.

```typescript
// Agent pays for compute
await agentWallet.sendBitcoin({
  address: computeProvider,
  amount: computeCost
})
```

**Why Arkade:** Instant, cheap payments enable micro-transactions that don't make sense onchain.

### Scheduled Payments

Automate recurring payments: subscriptions, payroll, or dollar-cost averaging.

**Why Arkade:** [Intent delegation](/arkd/components/intent-delegation) handles execution while you stay in control.

---

## Gaming & Collectibles

### In-Game Economies

Real Bitcoin as in-game currency. Players trade, earn, and spend without leaving the game.

**Why Arkade:** Instant transactions don't interrupt gameplay. Low fees make micro-rewards viable.

### Digital Collectibles

Issue and trade unique assets on Arkade with [Arkade Assets](/roadmap) (coming soon).

**Why Arkade:** Native Bitcoin assets without Ordinals' block space constraints.

---

## Enterprise

### Treasury Operations

Companies hold Bitcoin and need to move it efficiently between subsidiaries, pay vendors, or manage liquidity.

**Why Arkade:** Batch settlement reduces transaction costs. Audit trails via VTXO history.

### Payroll

Pay employees in Bitcoin instantly, regardless of how many recipients.

**Why Arkade:** One batch settles all payments. Recipients get spendable funds immediately.
