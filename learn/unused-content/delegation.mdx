### Why delegate?

Arkade's [batch expiry mechanism](/learn/pillars/batch-expiry) plays a key role in liquidity management. Periodic VTXO renewal enables efficient resource allocation, as expired VTXOs can be swept by the operator and the liquidity is redeployed to meet new demand.

However, expiry introduces [liveness requirements](/learn/security/liveness#user-liveness-vtxo-expiry) for users as they need to periodically renew their VTXOs to maintain unilateral exit rights. 

The **liveness requirement can be circumvented by delegating the VTXO renewal to a third party using the [Intent system](/arkd/components/intent-system)**. This ensures seamless renewal and removes the burden of monitoring expiry windows. Importantly, **users maintain full unilateral control over their funds throughout the process**.

Delegates are not exclusively limited to the operator. Wallet providers or other trusted services can also take on this role, offering users flexibility in how they manage liveness. For example, a wallet could automatically handle renewals in the background as part of its service, while more advanced users might choose to appoint a dedicated delegate or even run their own. This variety of options ensures that liveness can be managed according to individual preferences, without compromising unilateral control of funds.

### Delegate VTXO Setup

Intent Delegation is implemented at the VTXO level by embedding an additional spending path, the delegate path, into the output script:

- **A\+S (User \+ Server):** Standard cooperative path
- **A\+CSV (User after timelock):** Unilateral fallback path
- **A\+B\+S (User \+ Delegate \+ Server):** Delegation path requiring all three parties

<Tip>The delegate intent together with a submission time window is - as any other intent - signed with BIP322. This design ensures that a delegate (B) cannot move funds unilaterally, submit intents early, alter the outputs, or repurpose the intent.</Tip>

### TL;DR 

The Intent Delegation system offers the following benefits: 
- **User retains control**: All delegation requires presigned intents; funds remain non-custodial with unilateral exit always possible
- **Pre-committed inputs and outputs**: Intents define and sign exact inputs and outputs; delegates can't alter those or acces funds, but only hand what has been presigned 
- **Strict timing constraints**: Intents include time windows, this prevents a delegate to hand in an intent earlier than intended to collect associated fees 

By leveraging intent delegation, application developers can abstract batch expiry handling, delivering user experiences that feel just like existing self-custodial apps.
