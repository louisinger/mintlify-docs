<Warning>
  `arkd` is currently in alpha stage. It has undergone limited mainnet testing and should be considered experimental.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  The content in this tab is specifically aimed at you, if you are..

  1. ...an SDK/Library developer
  2. ..a developer wanting to build, but an SDK in your favorite language doesn’t exist yet
  3. ..an avid learner wanting to grok arkd API
</Tip>

`arkd` is the backbone of an Arkade instance, built on top of the Ark protocol. It facilitates [offchain transaction execution](/arkd/txs/offchain-execution), coordinates [onchain settlement](/arkd/txs/onchain-settlement) and manages VTXOs through the [Intent System](/arkd/components/intent-system).

This section outlines how to integrate with Arkade via `arkd` and its APIs.

**Main API Layer Services**

The `arkd` server is an always-on server and exposes two public gRPC services for Arkade clients:

- [ArkService](/arkd/core-services/ark-service)  - Handles batch processing, intent registration, and multi-party signing
- [IndexerService](/arkd/core-services/indexer-service) - Provides data queries for VTXOs, transaction history, and real-time subscriptions

To understand how client applications actually interact with arkd, see the [API Layer Overview](/arkd/core-services/overview).

**Core Architecture**

`arkd` consists of two main executable processes:

- [`arkd`](https://github.com/arkade-os/arkd) - The primary server process that hosts all core services, manages the Virtual Mempool and the coordination for onchain settlements
- [`arkd-wallet`](https://github.com/arkade-os/arkd/tree/master/pkg/arkd-wallet) - A separate wallet service process that provides Bitcoin wallet functionality and liquidity

<Tip>
  arkd supports multiple Bitcoin networks including regtest, testnet3, signet, mutinynet, and has undergone mainnet testing.

## Design Principles

The codebase follows a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Application Layer** [`internal/core/application/`](https://github.com/arkade-os/arkd/tree/4cabf95f33b0196c47518425e92efc089636aa20/internal/core/application): Implements core business logic and service operations
- **Domain Layer** [`internal/core/domain/`](https://github.com/arkade-os/arkd/tree/4cabf95f33b0196c47518425e92efc089636aa20/internal/core/domain): Contains models, events, and domain rules
- **Ports Layer** [`internal/core/ports/`](https://github.com/arkade-os/arkd/tree/4cabf95f33b0196c47518425e92efc089636aa20/internal/core/ports): Defines interfaces for external dependencies
- **Infrastructure Layer** [`internal/infrastructure/`](https://github.com/arkade-os/arkd/tree/4cabf95f33b0196c47518425e92efc089636aa20/internal/infrastructure): Provides concrete implementations of port interfaces
