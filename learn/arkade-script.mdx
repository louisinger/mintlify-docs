## 📝 Bitcoin Script

Bitcoin Script is a minimal, stack-based programming language used to lock and unlock UTXOs. The language itself is not Turing complete. 
It is purposefully constrained to allow static analysis and deterministic behavior. 
Standard opcodes support basic signature verification, timelocks, and hashlocks.

Every Arkade transaction builds directly on this foundation.

The script is never evaluated onchain unless the fallback path is activated. In the normal case, it is executed offchain
by the Ark Signer inside a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), allowing faster execution, longer chain of VTXOs and higher throughput.

## 👾 Arkade Script

Arkade Script extends Bitcoin’s contract model with expressive logic executed offchain. Every Arkade transaction
consumes one or more Virtual UTXOs (VTXOs) and creates new ones. These transactions are structured as a **DAG** within
the Virtual Mempool. There is no global state and no contention. Validation is local and concurrent.

The Ark Signer, operating in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), runs a constrained Bitcoin Script interpreter to
evaluate each Arkade transaction. If the logic passes, the signer applies a signature, producing a **preconfirmed**
transaction that can be used immediately in further offchain execution.

This model avoids reordering attacks, frontrunning, and state probing common in account-based blockchains.

### ⚙️ Commit-Reveal Flows

Arkade Script follows a **commit-reveal pattern**, where the initial VTXO represents a “locked” condition—escrow, swap,
or time-gated logic—and the follow-up transaction completes the execution.

Once the signer applies a preconfirmation, the second leg of the contract should proceed within milliseconds. This
real-time progression allows developers to treat offchain VTXOs as active contract state, executing logic that projects
forward to user ownership or payout conditions.

Applications like escrows and atomic swaps can express complex “lock” conditions up front and rely on the Arkade signer
to finalize the reveal without delay. The transition from locked state to unlocked spend is fast, trust-constrained, and
verifiable.

### ⏱️ Execution Scope and Expiration

Every VTXO belongs to a **batch** with an expiry. This fixed deadline ensures that scripts either complete or cleanly
expire. VTXOs with Arkade Script can be cooperatively redeemed using a **fallback** Taproot path that includes
participant keys, with a downside of interactity and cooperation, but makes sure Ark operator going offline before the
completion of the contract don't permanently lock the funds onchain.

### 🔐 Users Stay in Control

At every step, the user retains unilateral exit paths. Application developers may layer temporary trust assumptions—such
as burnable operator bonds—to support more expressive logic during preconfirmed execution. But the final spend path
always resolves back to Bitcoin. The fallback script never depends on the application or signer to remain online.

Arkade enables safe liveness without compromising self-custody.

### 🛠️ Arkade Script Extensions

The Arkade signer executes a full Bitcoin Script engine with additional opcodes. These
opcodes are not broadcast to the Bitcoin network and cannot be executed onchain.

Arkade Script extends standard Bitcoin Script with new capabilities:

- Introspection opcodes (e.g., `OP_INSPECTINPUTVALUE`, `OP_INSPECTOUTPUTVALUE`)
- Arithmetic and logical operations (e.g., `OP_ADD64`, `OP_MUL64`)
- Stack manipulation and control flow (e.g., `OP_CAT`, `OP_SUBSTR`)
- Elliptic curve operations (e.g., `OP_TWEAKVERIFY`, `OP_ECMULSCALARVERIFY`)
