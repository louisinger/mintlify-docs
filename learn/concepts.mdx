# Core Concepts

Arkade introduces a set of foundational primitives that reimagine Bitcoin transaction execution through virtualization. These components work together to provide instant execution, trust-minimized settlement, and scalable programmability—without modifying the Bitcoin protocol.

---

## VTXOs (Virtual Transaction Outputs)

VTXOs are Arkade’s offchain analog to Bitcoin’s UTXOs. Each VTXO represents spendable Bitcoin, but exists in a preconfirmed offchain state. Ownership is enforced via a cosigned transaction with the Arkade Signer, enabling near-instant execution. Every VTXO carries a unilateral Bitcoin exit path via a presigned transaction, ensuring censorship resistance and recoverability even in case of operator failure.

---

## Virtual Mempool

Arkade’s Virtual Mempool replaces Bitcoin’s linear transaction queue with a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of VTXO-based transactions. This structure explicitly encodes transaction dependencies, enabling multiple independent transaction chains to execute in parallel. The result: high throughput, low latency, and no global state bottlenecks.

---

## Arkade Transactions

Arkade Transactions are offchain transaction programs executed within the Arkade runtime. Submitted by users and preconfirmed by the operator’s cosignature, they allow instant offchain execution. Every Arkade transaction includes a deterministic fallback path—a presigned Bitcoin script—ensuring that it can be executed on Bitcoin L1 if needed. This architecture combines the responsiveness of offchain systems with Bitcoin-native security guarantees.

---

## Arkade Script

Arkade Script is an enhanced scripting language that compiles high-level logic into Bitcoin-enforceable execution paths. It extends Bitcoin Script with primitives for arithmetic, introspection, and stateful logic, enabling contracts like programmable vaults, decentralized trading, and agent coordination. ArkadeScript scripts execute offchain across VTXO chains and resolve to valid Bitcoin scripts when settled onchain—no protocol changes required.

---

## Dynamic Settlement

Arkade decouples transaction finality from block inclusion. Users receive instant preconfirmation when a transaction is cosigned by the Arkade Signer. When desired, users can commit these preconfirmed transactions onchain via a commitment transaction, anchoring the state to Bitcoin. This opt-in settlement model gives users fine-grained control over their tradeoffs between cost, speed, and security.

Arkade's primitives deliver a new execution layer for Bitcoin—one that maintains Bitcoin's core guarantees while unlocking a high-performance environment for complex applications.
