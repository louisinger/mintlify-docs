An Arkade Note is a [recoverable VTXO](/learn/pillars/vtxos#vtxo-states) and is **akin to a virtual voucher** created by the server and redeemable for VTXOs.

Arkade Notes are designed for several purposes: 

- **Smooth user onboarding**. An operator can issue Arkade Notes that users redeem for a VTXO
- **Offchain VTXO spending** Arkade Notes can be sent via standard communication channels (eg. messengers, NFC, ..)

### Arkade Note Structure 

Each note starts with the prefix `arknote` and contains ([`CreateNoteRequest`](https://github.com/arkade-os/arkd/blob/4cabf95f33b0196c47518425e92efc089636aa20/api-spec/protobuf/ark/v1/admin.proto#L84-L87)):

- **A Unique ID** (uint32): a distinct identifier for tracking each note
- **Value:** the amount this note is worth
- **Server Signature**: a signature on the `ID | amount` hash validating authenticity

Notes appear in the VTXO system as recoverable inputs. In the `GetVtxos` API, the [`recoverable_only`](https://github.com/arkade-os/arkd/blob/4cabf95f33b0196c47518425e92efc089636aa20/api-spec/protobuf/ark/v1/indexer.proto#L181-L183) filter specifically refers to notes, sub-dust, or swept VTXOs.


### Redeeming Arkade Notes

Redeeming a note works much like [spending a VTXO offchain](/arkd/txs/offchain-execution). Instead of providing a VTXO as an input to an [intent](/arkd/components/intent-system), the client includes the Arkade Note. The note is then marked as spent (ensuring double-spent protection) and replaced with a new VTXO belonging to the user.

### Distribution and Use Cases

Arkade Notes are simple **encoded text strings**, making them highly portable. They can be:

- Sent via chat or email
- Printed as QR codes
- Transferred over contactless technologies like NFC
