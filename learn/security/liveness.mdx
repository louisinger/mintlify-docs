## Liveness

Arkade's operational model involves two critical liveness requirements: operator availability and user activity management.

### Operator Liveness

Arkade uses a server-client architecture where operator downtime disrupts functionality. When the operator goes offline, users cannot initiate new transactions until the operator returns, but existing funds remain completely safe through presigned exit transactions. Users retain the ability to exit unilaterally at any time, regardless of operator status. The duration of any downtime depends entirely on the operator's infrastructure resilience and recovery capabilities.

### User Liveness (VTXO Expiry)

VTXOs have built-in expiry mechanisms that require periodic user attention. As VTXOs age in the virtual mempool, users must periodically swap them through batch settlement to avoid expiry. 

Expired VTXOs are swept by the Arkade Operator. While users may recover their funds, they lose the ability to unilaterally enforce ownership claims onchain. This creates natural incentives for users to remain active and settle their pre-confirmed VTXOs appropriately.

### Modular Architecture

Arkade's infrastructure is designed with a modular architecture that can be distributed and scaled independently. Core operator functions include validation and transaction cosigning, batch creation, liquidity provisioning, and overall system coordination with user interfaces.

This modular approach creates opportunities to scale Arkade horizontally and build redundancy options. Different functions can be replicated across multiple infrastructure providers, geographic regions, or even operated by different entities, reducing single points of failure and improving system resilience.
