Arkade enables programmable Bitcoin applications by separating execution from settlement and custody.\
\
This architectural separation creates unique trust boundaries:\
\
Execution is instant and offchain, coordinated by the operator and cosigned by the Arkade Signer. These transactions reside in a [presigned state until the user chooses to finalize them on Bitcoin](https://docs.arkadeos.com/learn/security/transaction-finality) via batch settlement. This dynamic model lets users decide when to move from preconfirmed execution to full onchain finality. Transactions in the Virtual Mempool form logical chains, relying on operator incentives until confirmed onchain.\
\
[Fund custody always remains under user control](https://docs.arkadeos.com/learn/security/unilateral-exit) and is enforceable onchain. Every Arkade transaction is fundamentally a presigned Bitcoin transaction with direct spending paths enforcing unilateral exit capability.\
\
This model enables instant programmable flows when speed is prioritized, with the option to inherit full Bitcoin security guarantees when needed.
