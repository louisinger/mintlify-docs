## Basics

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Arkade?">
    Arkade is a programmable execution layer for Bitcoin. It enables fast, self-custodial financial applications without requiring changes to the Bitcoin protocol.
    
    [Read more →](/learn/faq/what-is-arkade)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What problem does Arkade solve?">
    Arkade adds financial logic to Bitcoin payments. While Bitcoin excels as a store of value, it lacks the ability to express advanced financial logic without custodial services. Arkade delivers programmability, self-custody, parallel execution, and dynamic settlement.

  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Is Arkade a new blockchain?">
    No. Arkade is not a blockchain, sidechain, or rollup. It's an offchain execution layer that operates over native Bitcoin UTXOs using VTXOs, batch settlement, and presigned transaction paths.

  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Does Arkade require a token?">
    No. Arkade is BTC-native with no governance tokens or wrapped assets. All fees are paid in Bitcoin.

  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Is Arkade live?">
    Yes. Arkade is in public beta on Bitcoin mainnet with select launch partners. Developer SDKs are available on GitHub.

## Technical Concepts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What are VTXOs?">
    Virtual Transaction Outputs (VTXOs) are offchain objects that mirror Bitcoin's UTXO structure. Each VTXO is backed by a presigned Bitcoin transaction, giving users unilateral exit rights at all times.
    
    [Read more →](/learn/faq/what-are-vtxos)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What is the virtual mempool?">
    The virtual mempool is Arkade's offchain execution engine. It processes transactions in real-time using a DAG structure that enables parallel execution without global state bottlenecks.
    
    [Read more →](/learn/faq/what-is-the-virtual-mempool)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Who is the Arkade operator?">
    The Arkade operator coordinates offchain activity: validating transactions, issuing preconfirmations, and posting settlement batches to Bitcoin. The operator cannot control user funds—every VTXO includes presigned exit paths.
    
    [Read more →](/learn/faq/who-is-the-arkade-operator)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What is a batch output and how does settlement work?">
    Arkade batches thousands of offchain operations into a single Bitcoin transaction output. This dramatically reduces per-transaction costs while preserving individual control and Bitcoin security guarantees.
    
    [Read more →](/learn/faq/what-is-batch-output-and-onchain-settlement)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Are Arkade transactions real Bitcoin transactions?">
    Yes and no. Every Arkade transaction is structured like a Bitcoin transaction with valid presigned exit paths. However, they execute instantly offchain and batch settle to Bitcoin later.

  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What is Arkade Script?">
    Arkade Script is an enhanced scripting environment that extends Bitcoin Script with additional capabilities for programmable applications, including introspection, advanced arithmetic, and complex logic.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Security & Trust

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How does Arkade ensure self-custody?">
    Every VTXO includes a presigned exit path that lets you withdraw to Bitcoin at any time without operator cooperation. Your funds are always under your control.
    
    [Read more →](/learn/faq/how-does-arkade-ensure-self-custody)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What if the operator disappears or acts maliciously?">
    If the operator goes offline, you can exit unilaterally using presigned transactions. If the operator misbehaves, misconduct is cryptographically provable and economic penalties apply.
    
    [Read more →](/learn/faq/what-if-the-operator-disappears-or-acts-maliciously)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What's a TEE and how does Arkade use it?">
    A Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) provides hardware-backed security guarantees. Arkade uses TEEs to protect signing keys and enable verifiable proof that the operator is running expected code.

  </Accordion>

## Compatibility

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Does Arkade require changes to Bitcoin?">
    No. Arkade works with Bitcoin exactly as it exists today—no forks, no new opcodes, and no consensus changes required.
    
    [Read more →](/learn/faq/does-arkade-require-changes-to-bitcoin)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Will Arkade work with existing Bitcoin infrastructure?">
    Yes. Wallets can support Arkade using lightweight SDKs. Nodes remain unchanged. Services connect via APIs. Everything settles as standard Bitcoin transactions.
    
    [Read more →](/learn/faq/will-arkade-work-with-existing-bitcoin-infrastructure)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How does Arkade relate to the Ark protocol?">
    Arkade builds on Ark as a foundational component. Ark provides the anchoring and settlement layer. Arkade extends this into a complete execution environment for programmable Bitcoin applications.

</AccordionGroup>

## Building on Arkade

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What about the fees?">
    Arkade uses a batched fee model. Execution fees cover offchain transactions. Settlement fees for anchoring to Bitcoin are shared across all batch participants, dramatically reducing costs.
    
    [Read more →](/learn/faq/what-about-the-fees)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What kind of applications can be built on Arkade?">
    Smart wallets, trustless swaps, programmable payments, BTC-backed lending, decentralized trading, and coordination contracts with threshold access or delegation.
    
    [Read more →](/learn/faq/what-kind-of-applications-can-be-built-on-arkade)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I get started with Arkade?">
    Developers can explore the SDK on GitHub and review documentation. Users can wait for public launch or try partner integrations.
