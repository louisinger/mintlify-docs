## Overview

Arkade transactions work just like on-chain Bitcoin transactions - you send to addresses without requiring the recipient to be online. The key difference is that Arkade transactions are instant and have near-zero fees when sending to Arkade addresses. You can also send to Lightning invoices and Bitcoin addresses (bc1/tb1).

## Sending to Arkade Addresses

Use the `sendBitcoin` function to send to another Arkade wallet. Simply provide an Arkade address (starting with `ark1` or `tark1`) and the amount in satoshis. The recipient doesn't need to be online to receive the payment.

```typescript
// Send to an Arkade address
const txid = await wallet.sendBitcoin({
  address: 'tark12ld59yglpjkfezzhrr9cpe2ws4n87vs7rzv8234as3ctk9hly0r8w495snjdkk6fnwpwznlg56sutpy55n8a7nmkhumm4g7fckx9k4qrjc22t',
  amount: 50000,  // in satoshis
})

console.log('Transaction ID:', txid)
```

<Tip>
  **Like on-chain Bitcoin, but instant:** Payments to Arkade addresses work just like sending to a Bitcoin address - the recipient doesn't need to be online. The difference is that Arkade payments are instant and have near-zero fees, making them ideal for everyday transactions.

## Sending to Lightning Network

Send payments from your Arkade wallet to any Lightning invoice using submarine swaps. This allows you to pay Lightning users instantly.

## Sending to Bitcoin Addresses

To send Bitcoin to onchain addresses (bc1/tb1), use the Ramps class for offboarding. This converts your Arkade VTXOs back to onchain Bitcoin.

<Note>
  **Fee Comparison:**
  - Arkade addresses (`ark1`/`tark1`): Near-zero fees, instant, no online requirement
  - Lightning invoices: Low fees, instant via submarine swaps
  - Bitcoin addresses (`bc1`/`tb1`): Standard network fees apply (onchain swap)

  For regular onchain Bitcoin transactions, consider using the [offboarding process](/wallets/v0.3/ramps#exiting-collaboratively) instead for better control and potentially lower fees through batch processing.
