Arkade wallets are simple to integrate and use. Arkade integrates directly without external daemons by design. Developers can interact with the protocol using standard Bitcoin-compatible infrastructure and purpose-built native SDKs in various languages.
Whether you're building for your own custody or shipping self-custodial wallets for your users, the SDK is flexible by design. If you want to go deeper, the lower-level APIs give you everything you need to build custom integrations from scratch.


## Reference Wallet Implementation

Arkade provides a reference wallet implementation that demonstrates best practices and serves as a practical example for developers:

  Reference implementation with best practices for wallet integration
</Card>

The reference wallet showcases how to implement key features such as:

- Creating and managing self-custodial wallets
- Sending Bitcoin transactions in Arkade
- Balance and Payment detection
- Transaction history
- Service worker for background processing

Exploring this implementation can help you understand how to effectively integrate Arkade into your own applications.


## TypeScript SDK
