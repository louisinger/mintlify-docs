Arkade's architecture introduces two distinct levels of transaction confirmation, a preconfirmation state and full Bitcoin finality. Both states come with different security properties:

## Preconfirmation

A preconfirmed transaction is a Bitcoin transaction that is already validly constructed and cryptographically committed to, even though it hasn’t yet been broadcast or confirmed onchain. All offchain VTXOs in the [virtual mempool](/learn/pillars/virtual-mempool) operate under the preconfirmation trust model. It indicates that the [Arkade Signer](/learn/security/advanced-security#arkade-signer) has processed and cosigned the transaction, enabling the VTXO owner to use the resulting outputs for subsequent transactions. This mechanism allows for rapid and cost-effective execution within the offchain execution environment.

However, preconfirmations rely on the operator's integrity. A malicious operator could double-sign conflicting transactions, creating competing VTXO ownership chains that undermine a user's unilateral control over their assets. Any misbehavior can be cryptographically proven, while [economic incentives](/learn/security/economic-security) and [verifiable execution](/learn/security/advanced-security#verifiable-execution) ensure reliable operation.

## Bitcoin Finality

Arkade Transactions are considered settled once they achieved Bitcoin finality. This happens once a user anchors their preconfirmed VTXO(s) to the Bitcoin blockchain via a [batch swap](/learn/pillars/batch-swaps).

Batch swaps function like atomic swaps, enabling users to safely transfer their preconfirmed VTXOs to the operator in exchange for new VTXOs secured by an onchain Bitcoin transaction (ie. [commitment transaction](/learn/pillars/batch-swaps#commitment-transactions).

<Tip>
  Users are encouraged to periodically settle their offchain transactions onchain through batch swaps to fully secure their holdings.

## Dynamic Settlement

Arkade allows users to dynamically transition between preconfirmation and Bitcoin finality. This flexibility enables participants to operate in the fast, low-cost offchain environment when convenience and speed are paramount, and to anchor their state to Bitcoin via participating in a [batch settlement](/learn/pillars/batch-swaps), when stronger guarantees of immutability and censorship resistance are required. Users can choose the optimal point to settle, striking a balance between efficiency and security based on their needs.
