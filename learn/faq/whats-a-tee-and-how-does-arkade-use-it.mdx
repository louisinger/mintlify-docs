A Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) is a secure hardware enclave that provides:
- Isolated, encrypted execution of sensitive code
- Cryptographic attestation of software integrity
- Hardware-backed security guarantees

[Arkade uses TEEs](/learn/security/advanced-security#verifiable-execution) for:
- Arkade Signer: Protects signing keys from operator access
- Remote attestation: Proves only authorized code is running
- Encrypted communication: Enables private user-signer interaction

TEEs transform the “trust the operator” assumption into “verify the operator”.
