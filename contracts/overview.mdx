## Bitcoin's UTXO Model

Bitcoin tracks ownership through **Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs)**. Each UTXO locks value to a script defining spending conditions. Transactions consume UTXOs as inputs and create new ones as outputs.

This provides local validation (no global state), strong composability, and a DAG structure. The tradeoff: every spend requires onchain confirmation—block delays, fee competition, and mempool constraints make multi-step contracts fragile or expensive.

## Why Bitcoin L1 Falls Short

Block space is scarce, blocks arrive ~10 minutes apart, and demand is unpredictable. Result: unpredictable latency, volatile fees, unreliable ordering. Real-time or interactive contracts cannot rely on onchain execution alone.

Traditional Bitcoin script uses **commit-reveal patterns**—lock funds, reveal values when spending. Works for atomic swaps and HTLCs. Breaks for persistent state, sequential updates, or multi-party coordination. Script cannot enforce output constraints or contract continuity.

## How Arkade L2 Solves This

Arkade replaces UTXOs with **Virtual Transaction Outputs (VTXOs)**—offchain outputs that execute instantly while preserving unilateral control of funds at any time.

**Dynamic settlement**: transactions receive instant preconfirmation, then settle onchain in the next economically optimal batch anchored to a Bitcoin block. Users choose their finality tradeoff—speed now, full Bitcoin security on settlement.

## Scripting on Arkade

Arkade supports **standard Bitcoin Tapscript** for VTXO spending conditions. Any valid Tapscript works as a VTXO locking script.

For multi-party contracts, a collaborative **unilateral exit path** can be added. This provides emergency exit if the server becomes unavailable.

### Arkade Script (Experimental)

Arkade Script extends Bitcoin Script with additional opcodes executable **only in the offchain environment**. These opcodes enable transaction introspection and state enforcement, but operate under **preconfirmation trust assumptions**—VTXOs using extended opcodes live in continuous preconfirmation state until settled onchain.

Stateful contracts face batch expiry like any VTXO. The [Intent System](/arkd/components/intent-system) and [Intent Delegation](/arkd/components/intent-delegation) enable automatic renewal without user intervention.
