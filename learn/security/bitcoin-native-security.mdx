Arkade enables programmable Bitcoin applications by **separating execution from settlement and custody**.

This architectural separation creates unique trust boundaries: **execution** happens instantly offchain through operator coordination, while **settlement and custody** remain under user control and enforceable onchain.

Using a presigned transaction architecture, Arkade coordinates fast, programmable execution offchain while settlement and custody remain anchored to Bitcoin's security model. Every Arkade transaction is fundamentally a Bitcoin transaction with direct spending paths enforcing unilateral exit capability.

Instant transaction execution happens through a preconfirmation mechanism. User transactions are co-signed by the Arkade Signer in the **Virtual Mempool**, forming chains of transaction logic. This mechanism requires users to rely on operator incentives during preconfirmed execution.

Users maintain control over their funds and choose when to transition from a preconfirmed state to Bitcoin finality through batch settlements. This model enables instant programmable flows when speed is prioritized, with the option to inherit full Bitcoin security guarantees when needed.

**Architecture Note**: Unlike bridge-based systems that create wrapped Bitcoin requiring trust in external validators, Arkade's presigned transaction model means every Virtual Transaction Output (VTXO) is backed by a valid Bitcoin transaction. Users hold the cryptographic keys to exit unilaterally at any time, transforming offchain execution from a custody model into a coordination model.
