  **Experimental Technology**
  
  All code and concepts presented in this documentation are for exploration and proof of concept purposes only. These examples should not be used in production environments. The Arkade Language ecosystem is under active development and subject to significant changes.
</Warning>

Arkade Script is a Bitcoin scripting language for the VTXO (Virtual Transaction Output) model. It provides two execution paths:

1. **Immediate Execution** - Server co-signature for instant finality
2. **Timelock Unilateral Path** - On-chain redemption fallback

## Arkade Script

This documentation outlines the proposed syntax and functionality for Arkade Script contracts.
