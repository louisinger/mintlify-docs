 The [virtual mempool](/learn/pillars/virtual-mempool) is Arkade's offchain execution layer, a dynamic coordination environment for Bitcoin-native applications.

It powers real-time transaction flows that:
- Emulate Bitcoin’s UTXO model through Virtual Transaction Outputs (VTXOs)
- Execute in parallel without global state bottlenecks
- Let users control when (and if) to anchor to the Bitcoin blockchain (["dynamic settlement"](/learn/security/transaction-finality#dynamic-settlement))

Arkade’s execution layer is designed for scale. Transactions form a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that enables independent branches to execute simultaneously. Execution is instant, and settlement is batched onchain.
