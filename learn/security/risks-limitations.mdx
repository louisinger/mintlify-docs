Arkade has trade-offs. Understanding them helps you use the system appropriately.

## Risk Summary

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| **Mass exit congestion** | Low | High fees during exit | Settle early, maintain larger VTXOs |
| **Operator downtime** | Medium | Can't transact (funds safe) | Unilateral exit available |
| **VTXO expiry** | Medium | Lose unilateral exit | Delegation, active management |
| **Signer compromise** | Very Low | Double-spend possible | TEE, slashing, exit immediately |
| **Deep chain costs** | Medium | Expensive unilateral exit | Settle periodically |

## Mass Exit Scenarios

When many users exit simultaneously, Bitcoin block space becomes contested.

### Triggers

- Operator goes permanently offline
- Security vulnerability discovered
- Regulatory action
- Loss of confidence

### What Happens

| User Type | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Large VTXO holders | Can afford exit fees |
| Small VTXO holders | Exit may cost more than balance |
| Deep chain users | Many txs to broadcast = high fees |

### Mitigations

**For users:**
- Keep VTXOs above dust threshold (~1000 sats minimum)
- Settle periodically to reset chain depth
- Don't wait until expiry to renew

**System-level:**
- Operator incentivized to restore service (loses fee revenue)
- Modular architecture enables migration to backup infrastructure

<Warning>
In extreme cases, small VTXOs may become uneconomical to exit. Wait for fees to decrease, or accept the loss.
</Warning>

## Operator Downtime

Arkade uses a client-server model. When the operator is offline:

| What Works | What Doesn't |
|------------|--------------|
| ✅ Unilateral exit | ❌ New transactions |
| ✅ Access existing VTXOs | ❌ Batch swaps |
| ✅ Broadcast presigned txs | ❌ Collaborative exit |
| | ❌ VTXO renewal |

**Your funds are always safe** via presigned exit transactions. The risk is inconvenience and potential expiry if downtime is extended.

### Extended Downtime Risks

If downtime exceeds your VTXO expiry window:
1. You must exit unilaterally before expiry, OR
2. Your VTXOs become recoverable (not unilaterally enforceable)

Delegate to a third party if you can't monitor expiry yourself.

## Signer Compromise

The Arkade Signer holds the cosigning key for all VTXOs. If compromised:

### Attack Vector

```
Attacker gains Signer key
        ↓
Signs conflicting transactions
        ↓
Same VTXO "spent" to multiple parties
        ↓
Only one can claim onchain
```

### Detection

| Signal | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Remote attestation fails | TEE running unexpected code |
| Conflicting signatures exist | Double-signing occurred |
| Operator halts system | Breach detected |

### Response

1. **Stop creating new VTXOs** — don't add to exposure
2. **Exit immediately** — broadcast presigned exit transactions
3. **Race condition** — first valid exit claims the funds

### Why It's Unlikely

| Protection | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| TEE isolation | Key never leaves secure enclave |
| Remote attestation | Verifiable code execution |
| Slashing | Economic penalty destroys collateral |
| Open source | Auditable implementation |

<Info>
TEE compromise requires sophisticated attacks (side-channels, hardware exploits). It's not impossible, but significantly harder than pure software attacks.
</Info>

## Deep Transaction Chains

Chaining many offchain transactions increases unilateral exit cost.

### The Problem

```
VTXO-1 → Tx1 → VTXO-2 → Tx2 → VTXO-3 → Tx3 → VTXO-4
                                              ↑
                                    4 txs to exit
```

Each transaction in the chain must be broadcast separately to exit.

| Chain Depth | Exit Cost (at 10 sat/vB) |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| 1 tx | ~1,500 sats |
| 5 txs | ~7,500 sats |
| 10 txs | ~15,000 sats |
| 20 txs | ~30,000 sats |

### Mitigation

[Settle periodically](/learn/pillars/batch-swaps) to reset chain depth to 1.

## VTXO Expiry

VTXOs have a limited lifetime. Missing renewal has consequences.

| Before Expiry | After Expiry |
|---------------|--------------|
| ✅ Unilateral exit | ❌ Unilateral exit |
| ✅ Full self-custody | ⚠️ Recoverable via batch swap |
| ✅ Spend freely | ❌ Can't spend directly |

### Mitigation Options

| Approach | Effort | Best For |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Manual renewal | High | Active users |
| Delegation | Low | Passive holders |
| Exit to Bitcoin | One-time | Long-term storage |

## Known Limitations

| Limitation | Workaround |
|------------|------------|
| Requires operator online for transactions | Unilateral exit always available |
| VTXOs expire | Renewal or delegation |
| Exit costs scale with chain depth | Periodic settlement |
| Sub-dust VTXOs can't exit unilaterally | Combine via batch swap |
| Preconfirmation trusts operator | TEE + slashing + settlement |

## Making Informed Decisions

| If You Want | Then |
|-------------|------|
| Maximum security | Settle to Bitcoin finality frequently |
| Lowest fees | Stay preconfirmed, accept operator trust |
| Passive holding | Use delegation or exit to onchain |
| Active trading | Preconfirmed is fine, settle periodically |
