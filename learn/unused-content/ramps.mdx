Arkade is designed as an extension of Bitcoin. To use it, users need a way to take Bitcoin in and, just as importantly, a way to take it back out. These entry and exit points are called **ramps**.

- **Boarding (Onboarding)** into Arkade can happen in two ways:
  - **Peer-to-peer**: a user can simply receive a VTXO from another Arkade participant, no onchain interaction needed
  - **From Bitcoin**: a user can send Bitcoin to a dedicated boarding address, which converts the onchain UTXO into an offchain VTXO inside Arkade
- **Exiting (Offboarding)** returns funds to Bitcoin. This can be done:
  - **Collaboratively**, with the operator, which is efficient and simple
  - **Unilaterally**, without the operator, which is always possible but more complex and costly

This dual design ensures flexibility: users can seamlessly enter Arkade either by transacting with peers or by boarding directly from Bitcoin, and they always retain guaranteed exit paths back to the base layer.
