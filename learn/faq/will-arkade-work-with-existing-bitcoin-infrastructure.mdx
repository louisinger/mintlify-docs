Yes. Arkade integrates seamlessly with existing Bitcoin infrastructure requiring no changes to the base layer.

Compatibility:
- Wallets can support Arkade using lightweight SDKs alongside normal Bitcoin transactions
- Nodes remain unchanged — operators run standard Bitcoin Core with Arkade software layered on top
- Services like exchanges and payment processors connect via APIs that abstract Virtual Mempool complexity
- Settlement uses standard Bitcoin transactions, fully compatible with existing tools

Everything appears as normal Bitcoin UTXOs onchain, ensuring complete compatibility with the existing ecosystem.
