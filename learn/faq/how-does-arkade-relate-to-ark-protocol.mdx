The Ark protocol introduced a method for offchain transaction batching and unilateral exits via presigned transactions.

Arkade builds on Ark as a foundational component:
- Ark provides the anchoring and settlement layer
- Arkade provides the execution and coordination layer

Arkade extends Ark beyond simple payments into a complete execution environment for programmable Bitcoin applications.
