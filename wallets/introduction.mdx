Arkade wallets are simple to integrate and use. Arkade integrates directly without external daemons by design. Developers can interact with the protocol using standard Bitcoin-compatible infrastructure and purpose-built native SDKs in various languages.

Whether you're building for your own custody or shipping self-custodial wallets for your users, the SDK is flexible by design. If you want to go deeper, the lower-level APIs give you everything you need to build custom integrations from scratch.


## TypeScript SDK

In the following developer guides, we'll primarily use JavaScript/TypeScript for examples, but the concepts apply to all SDKs.

<Accordion title="Supported Platforms" icon="laptop-code" defaultOpen={true}>
  Our TypeScript SDK supports multiple platforms:

  - **Browser** - For web applications
  - **React Native** - For mobile applications
  - **Node.js** - For server-side applications
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Key Features" icon="star">
  - **Self-custody** - You control your keys, always
  - **Instant Payments** - No waiting for confirmations with off-chain transactions
  - **Low Fees** - Significantly reduced transaction costs
  - **Simple API** - Intuitive methods that abstract away complexity
  - **Bitcoin-compatible** - Works with standard Bitcoin infrastructure
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Getting Support" icon="headset">

    <FileTree.File name="tsconfig.json" />
    <FileTree.File name=".env" />
    <FileTree.File name="README.md" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>
