Arkade wallets are simple to integrate and use. Arkade integrates directly without external daemons by design. Developers can interact with the protocol using standard Bitcoin-compatible infrastructure and purpose-built native SDKs in various languages.

Whether you're building for your own custody or shipping self-custodial wallets for your users, the SDK is flexible by design. If you want to go deeper, the lower-level APIs give you everything you need to build custom integrations from scratch.


## TypeScript SDK

In the following developer guides, we'll primarily use JavaScript/TypeScript for examples, but the concepts apply to all SDKs.

Our TypeScript SDK supports multiple platforms:

- **Browser** - For web applications
- **React Native** - For mobile applications
- **Node.js** - For server-side applications


This is just the beginning. If there's something you wish the SDK did — tell us. We're listening.

### Other Languages

Arkade also provides libraries for other programming languages:

- **Rust** - [Arkade Rust Crates](https://github.com/arkade-os/rust-sdk)
- **Go** - [Arkade Go Package](https://github.com/arkade-os/go-sdk)

Refer to the respective README files for detailed usage instructions.
