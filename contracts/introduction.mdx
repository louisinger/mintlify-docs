# Advanced Contracts

Arkade's advanced contracting system allows you to create sophisticated financial instruments on Bitcoin. This guide will help you understand how to develop, test, and deploy complex contracts.

## Contract Types

### Atomic Swaps
Create trustless cross-chain exchanges between different assets.

### Lending Contracts
Build contracts for collateralized lending and borrowing.

### Options and Derivatives
Implement financial derivatives and options contracts with predefined conditions.

## Contract Components

```typescript
interface ArkadeContract {
  // Contract identifier
  id: string;
  
  // Participants in the contract
  participants: string[];
  
  // Contract conditions
  conditions: ContractCondition[];
  
  // Settlement rules
  settlement: SettlementRules;
}
```

## Security Considerations

- Time-locked transactions
- Multi-signature requirements
- Dispute resolution mechanisms

## Development Process

1. Design contract logic
2. Implement and test locally
3. Deploy to testnet
4. Audit and verify
5. Deploy to mainnet
