## Prerequisites

<Tip>
  Ensure you have the following installed before getting started:

  - Node.js (v22 or higher)
</Tip>

## Installation

```bash
npm install @arkade-os/sdk
```

## Basic Setup

<Note>
  When creating a wallet, you can use an existing private key or generate a new one. For production applications, always use a secure key management solution rather than hardcoded keys.
</Note>

```typescript
import { SingleKey, Wallet } from '@arkade-os/sdk'

// use your private key in hex format  
const identity = SingleKey.fromHex('secret')

// create a wallet instance
const wallet = await Wallet.create({
  identity,
  arkServerUrl: 'https://arkade.computer',
})

// You can receive bitcoin offchain instantly! No inbound liquidity!
const address = await wallet.getAddress()
console.log('Ark Address:', address)
```
