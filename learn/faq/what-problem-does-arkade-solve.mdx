Arkade adds [financial logic](/contracts/arkade-script) to bitcoin payments.

Bitcoin is the world’s most secure monetary network, but its potential as programmable money remains largely untapped. While Bitcoin excels as a store of value, it has [certain limitations](/contracts/background) and lacks the ability to express advanced financial logic without custodial services or bridges to alternative chains.

Arkade delivers:
- Programmability - add financial logic to payments
- [Self-custody](/learn/security/unilateral-exit) - users retain unilateral exit control to Bitcoin L1
- Parallel execution - scale Bitcoin payments horizontally in the [virtual mempool](/learn/pillars/virtual-mempool)
- [Dynamic settlement](/learn/security/transaction-finality#dynamic-settlement) - users control their fund’s finality state

Arkade enables a new era of programmable finance, directly anchored to the most secure monetary base ever created.
