## Sending Bitcoin in Arkade

The `sendBitcoin` is used to send an Arkade payment. It automatically detects the address type and routes the payment accordingly.

<Warning>
  When sending to onchain Bitcoin addresses, standard Bitcoin network fees will apply. Sending to Ark addresses (starting with `ark1` or `tark1`) will have near-zero fees.
</Warning>

```typescript
// Send bitcoin (automatically chooses on-chain or off-chain based on the address)
const txid = await wallet.sendBitcoin({
  address: 'tark12ld59yglpjkfezzhrr9cpe2ws4n87vs7rzv8234as3ctk9hly0r8w495snjdkk6fnwpwznlg56sutpy55n8a7nmkhumm4g7fckx9k4qrjc22t',
  amount: 50000,  // in satoshis
})

console.log('Transaction ID:', txid)
```
