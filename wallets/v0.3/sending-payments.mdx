## Sending Bitcoin in Arkade

The `sendBitcoin` function is used to send an Arkade payment. The SDK automatically detects the address type (onchain or offchain) and routes the payment accordingly.

<Warning>
  **Fees:**

  - Sending to onchain Bitcoin addresses, standard Bitcoin network fees apply. 
  - Sending to offchain Arkade addresses (`ark1` or `tark1`) near-zero fees apply.
</Warning>

```typescript
// Send bitcoin (automatically chooses onchain or offchain based on address type)
const txid = await wallet.sendBitcoin({
  address: 'tark12ld59yglpjkfezzhrr9cpe2ws4n87vs7rzv8234as3ctk9hly0r8w495snjdkk6fnwpwznlg56sutpy55n8a7nmkhumm4g7fckx9k4qrjc22t',
  amount: 50000,  // in satoshis
})

console.log('Transaction ID:', txid)
```
