Scheduled Sessions are a configurable time windows in `arkd` during which the Arkade operator may offer lower or zero-fee settlements. They operate **in addition** to periodic settlement sessions, creating synchronized periods where many clients settle at the same time. 

By participating in scheduled sessions, clients can take advantage of reduced or waived fees while helping aggregate activity into fewer onchain transactions, improving efficiency for both users and the operator.

Scheduled Sessions are defined via [`ScheduledSessionConfig`](https://github.com/arkade-os/arkd/blob/e16538b52131080ef247f6fed176db0d15a378bc/api-spec/protobuf/ark/v1/admin.proto#L212-L220):

```typescript
message ScheduledSessionConfig {
  int64 start_time = 1;
  int64 end_time = 2;
  int64 period = 3;
  int64 duration = 4;
  int64 round_min_participants_count = 5;
  int64 round_max_participants_count = 6;
  FeeInfo fees = 7;
}
```

They are governed by a few key parameters:

- `start_time`: Start of scheduled session (Unix timestamp) 
- `end_time`: End of scheduled session (Unix timestamp)
- `period`: Time interval between scheduled sessions (in seconds)
- `duration`: Duration of a scheduled session
- `round_min_participants_count`: Lower threshold for the number of users required for a scheduled session
- `round_max_participants_count`: Upper threshold for the number of users allowed for a scheduled session
- `fees`: Fee structure applied during the scheduled session (e.g. discounted or zero-fee rates)

By aligning client operations within these shared windows, scheduled sessions provide a more efficient and predictable framework for transaction processing in Arkade.

<Tip>Clients can query the `ArkService` via `GetInfo` which will return the announced session times.</Tip>
