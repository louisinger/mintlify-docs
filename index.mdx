# Welcome to Arkade

Arkade is a programmable execution layer for Bitcoin that virtualizes transaction logic without modifying the Bitcoin protocol. 
It is built on top of the [Ark protocol](https://docs.arklabs.xyz/ark.pdf), which introduced foundational primitives like [**Virtual UTXOs (VTXOs)**](https://docs.arklabs.xyz/ark/deep-dive/vtxos) and [**Batch Swaps**](https://docs.arklabs.xyz/ark/deep-dive/batch-swaps) to enable scalable, self-custodial offchain transactions. Arkade extends these concepts into a full-fledged execution environment optimized for real-world application logic.

Bitcoin’s base layer is intentionally constrained to preserve decentralization and security. Arkade complements it by enabling complex application logic—trading, lending, payments—on a scalable offchain layer, while preserving self-custody and settlement finality.

Through innovations like the **Virtual Mempool**, **ArkadeScript**, and **Dynamic Settlement**, Arkade delivers cloud-like parallelism and composability for Bitcoin-native applications—without soft forks, bridges, or wrapped assets.

<Card title="What is Ark?" icon="anchor">
  Ark is a Bitcoin-native transaction batching protocol that introduced **Virtual UTXOs (VTXOs)** and **Batch Settlements**. It allows users to transact offchain while retaining full custody of their funds, with deterministic exit paths back to Bitcoin L1.
  
  Arkade builds directly on Ark, extending its capabilities into a full virtual execution environment for complex, scalable financial applications.

## What Makes Arkade Different

### 🔧 Programmable Money
Arkade makes Bitcoin truly programmable. Developers can write contracts using **Arkade Script**, a stateful, expressive scripting language that compiles into Bitcoin-compatible execution flows. Contracts are tied directly to Bitcoin outputs, ensuring enforceability.

### 🔐 Self-Custodial Security
VTXOs grant users unilateral exit rights, enforced through presigned Bitcoin transactions. All contracts are auditable, and users retain full control over their assets at all times. No bridges. No custodians. No wrapped assets.

### 🧠 Parallel Execution
Arkade replaces Bitcoin’s linear mempool with a **Virtual Mempool**, enabling independent VTXO-based transactions to execute in parallel. This eliminates global contention and unlocks horizontal scalability for Bitcoin applications.

### 🛡️ Verifiable Trust
Transactions receive instant offchain preconfirmation by TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments) called **Arkade Signers**. These signers attest to execution integrity and reject double-spends. Finality is achieved by anchoring batches on-chain via Bitcoin commitment transactions.

### 💧 Unified Liquidity
Multiple VTXO operations are batched and settled into a single on-chain output, dramatically reducing fee overhead and enabling efficient markets. Liquidity can be sourced from multiple providers, ensuring deep, decentralized capital.

## Use Arkade To Build:

- **Smart Wallets** with programmable spending conditions leveraging secure enclaves of modern smartphones and laptops.
- **Lending Protocols** using natively collateralized BTC with verifiable liquidation rules.
- **Decentralized Exchanges** with high frequency cross-chain swaps.
- **Machine-to-Machine Payments** for AI agents to purchase goods and services on your behalf or autonomously consume web services.
- **Margin Trading with Bitcoin** with configurable leverage, without giving up self-custody of the margin collateral.
