When a user wants to move participate in a [batch swap](/learn/pillars/batch-swaps) that settles on Bitcoin for finality they do so via handing an intent to the operator using the [intent system](/arkd/components/intent-system) who then validates the transaction declaration and, if valid, includes the users intent in the next commitment transaction.

Technically, Arkade **intents are valid-but-unmineable Bitcoin transactions** that encode an ownership proof of the inputs (via [BIP322](/learn/glossary#bip322)) a user wants to redeem - whether it's offchain VTXOs, an onchain UTXO or expired coins - and define the outputs they wish to receive.

Intents separate control from coordination: users retain control of their keys while the operator coordinates the batch settlement and the Arkade Signer cosigns. If desired, a user can also hand an intent to a third-party delegate, for example to renew a VTXO before [expiry](/learn/pillars/batch-expiry).

<Tip>
  If a user choses to delegate VTXO renewal and circumvent the corresponding liveness requirement, they never give up keys or fund control in the process, preserving autonomy while reducing operational overhead.
