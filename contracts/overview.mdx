Arkade Script is a Bitcoin scripting language for the VTXO (Virtual Transaction Output) model. It provides two execution paths:

1. **Immediate Execution** - Server co-signature for instant finality
2. **Timelock Unilateral Path** - On-chain redemption fallback

## Arkade Script

This documentation outlines the proposed syntax and functionality for Arkade Script contracts.

### Development Status

The current prototype includes:

- **Basic Compiler** - Early version that converts Arkade Script to Bitcoin Script
- **Limited Testing Tools** - Basic verification of contract logic

All tools are in early experimental stages and NOT ready for production use.
