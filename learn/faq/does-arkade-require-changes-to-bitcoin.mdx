No. Arkade does not require any changes to the Bitcoin protocol.

How it works:
- All activity happens offchain using standard Bitcoin transaction structures
- Settlement uses normal Bitcoin transactions and Taproot outputs
- Presigned exits preserve user custody

Arkade delivers programmability and scale today. Bitcoin remains the secure foundation while Arkade extends what’s possible above it.
