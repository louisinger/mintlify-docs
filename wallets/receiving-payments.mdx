## Overview

Receiving payments with Arkade is simple and efficient. Your wallet can generate addresses for both boarding and ark payments, allowing your users to send Bitcoin to you through either method.

## Getting Your Wallet Address

To receive payments, you first need to generate an address:

```typescript
const offchainAddress = await wallet.getAddress()
const boardingAddress = await wallet.getBoardingAddress()

// The off-chain Ark address for instant payments
console.log('Ark Address:', offchainAddress)

// The on-chain boarding address
console.log('Bitcoin Address:', boardingAddress)
```

## Ark Addresses

Ark addresses start with `ark1` on Bitcoin mainnet or `tark1` on testnet and regtest.

## Monitoring for Incoming Payments

To detect when payments are received, you can use `Wallet.notifyIncomingFunds()` for incoming transactions in real-time.

```typescript

// Example function to process incoming funds
async function processIncomingFunds(notification: IncomingFunds) {
  // Update your application state
  switch (notification.type) {
    case 'vtxo':
      for (const vtxo of notification.vtxos) {
        console.log(`Received payment of ${vtxo.amount} sats`);
        
        // You might want to store the VTXO in your database
        await storeVtxoInDatabase(vtxo);
        
        // Notify the user
        showNotification(`Received ${vtxo.amount} sats!`);
        
        // Update the UI
        await refreshBalanceDisplay();
      }
      break;
    case 'utxo':
      for (const utxo of notification.utxos) {
        await storeBoardingUtxoInDatabase(utxo)

        // Notify the user
        showNotification(`Received ${utxo.amount} sats on boarding address!`);
        
        // Update the UI
        await refreshBalanceDisplay();
      }
      break;
  }
}

// Start the subscription
const stop = wallet.notifyIncomingFunds(processIncomingFunds)

// Stop the subscription
stop()
```

### Best Practices

<Accordion title="Error Handling" icon="shield-check">
  Always implement proper error handling for your subscription to ensure your application remains stable even if there are network issues.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Reconnection Logic" icon="arrow-repeat">
  Consider implementing reconnection logic if the subscription is interrupted due to network issues.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Deduplication" icon="filter">
  Implement deduplication logic to ensure you don't process the same payment multiple times, especially if your application restarts.
</Accordion>
